# Delivery_Bike_Car_pytorch
As part of the pytorch learning series this project there are three phase approach we are taking:

1. Firstly, finding out whether the delivery man should take up the job, if the he will or not be able to cover distance of 5 miles will be able to do it within 30 mins on bike.
2. What would happen if car and bike are introduced.
3. Using activation function ReLU, will the prediction model to make the decision.
